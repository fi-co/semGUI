SemGUI is a professional-grade tool for arranging words in a two-dimensional space, designed for linguistic and cognitive research. Built with **Python 3.11** and **Tkinter**, the application records participant interactions for subsequent semantic analysis.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Interactive 2‑D canvas** – place and drag words freely during each trial
- 💾 **Automatic saving** – sessions are logged so experiments can be resumed
- 🔄 **Multi-trial workflow** – manage multiple rounds of word placement
- 📊 **CSV import/export** – easily load stimuli and gather results

## Advanced Capabilities

- 🔍 **Zoom and pan** – navigate the word space with mouse wheel zoom and arrow-key panning
- 🎲 **Jittered placement** – new words appear with slight randomness to avoid overlap
- ✨ **Highlighter mode** – toggle highlighting to mark uncertain words
- 🗂️ **Session recovery** – JSON logs allow seamless restoration after interruptions
